# SecondLife-PopulationMeter
A simple LSL population meter for Second Life that shows a graph and some numbers in hovertext, keeps track of highest and lowest seen values.

Rez a prim, add the script, job done.

Default values for DEPTH and FREQUENCY update every 30 minutes and shows the last 12 hours as a chart.
